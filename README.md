# Week_4

An online quiz using DOM queries and local storage to execute and grade a quiz to be taken by the user. 

## Description

The user is greeted by an introduction window, prompting them to take a quiz based on basic javascript principles. After clicking the "start quiz" button, the quiz will begin, with a timer set over the questions. The quiz is made up of multiple choice questions using radio inputs. Click a radio input and click "next". Once the user has finished the quiz or the timer has run out of time, the outro card will be displayed and the user will be prompted to add their initials. Once their initials are added, the initials and the score will be added to local storage so that it may displayed on the scoreboard that will show up after the initials are added.
